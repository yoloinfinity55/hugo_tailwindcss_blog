This project is a static blog generator built using **Hugo** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**.

Here's a breakdown of its key components and how it works:

1.  **Hugo:** A fast and flexible static site generator written in Go. It takes content files (like Markdown) and uses Go Templates to build a complete website.
2.  **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development. It's configured in `tailwind.config.js` and processed to generate the final CSS.
3.  **Markdown:** Content for blog posts is written in Markdown files located in the `content/` directory.
4.  **Archetypes:** Post templates, or archetypes, are used to pre-fill front matter for new content, ensuring consistency.
